# K8s Agent Design Overview

The k8s-agent is the outbound-only cluster edge that connects to the control plane, uploads snapshots, and executes JSON-RPC tool calls with explicit write gating.

Primary design sources:

- [Architecture](/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Design Index](/docs/design-docs/index.md)
- [Core Beliefs](/docs/design-docs/core-beliefs.md)
- [Contracts](/docs/contracts/README.md)

Use this document as the top-level routing layer for design questions. Put durable, focused design detail in the linked leaf docs rather than growing this file.
