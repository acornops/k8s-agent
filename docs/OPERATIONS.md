# AgentK Operations

## Runtime Contract

- The agent uses an outbound WebSocket to the platform.
- The default install is one read-only replica.
- Multi-replica installs are active-passive only and require Kubernetes Lease leader election.
- Write-capable tools require explicit RBAC and configuration opt-in.
- The control-plane session may narrow locally enabled tools and namespaces but cannot expand them.

## Required Environment

- `ACORNOPS_AGENT_PLATFORM_URL`
- `ACORNOPS_CLUSTER_ID`
- `ACORNOPS_AGENT_KEY` or an existing Secret referenced by the Helm chart
- `ACORNOPS_AGENT_WRITE_ENABLED`
- `ACORNOPS_AGENT_LEADER_ELECTION_ENABLED`

## Helm Operations

Install into a workload cluster:

```bash
helm upgrade --install acornops-agent oci://ghcr.io/acornops/charts/acornops-agentk \
  --namespace acornops \
  --create-namespace \
  --set-string config.platformUrl=https://api.acornops.dev \
  --set-string config.clusterId=YOUR_CLUSTER_ID \
  --set-string config.agentKey=YOUR_AGENT_KEY
```

Check rollout:

```bash
kubectl -n acornops rollout status deployment/acornops-agent
kubectl -n acornops logs -f deployment/acornops-agent
```

## Snapshot Scalability

The snapshot pipeline uses a Kubernetes watch-backed local cache by default. The agent still sends periodic compact `notify/snapshot` payloads to the control plane, but steady-state resource changes come from watch streams and debounced change-triggered snapshots instead of full-list polling on every interval.

Bounded, paginated list calls are still used for initial cache sync, namespace-scope changes, 410-compaction recovery, and fallback when the watch cache is disabled, warming, or unhealthy. Monitor `snapshot-manager` logs for `durationMs`, `skippedSnapshots`, `droppedSnapshots`, `originalBytes`, and `compressedBytes`, and monitor `watch-manager` logs for repeated relist or reconnect warnings. If snapshots regularly skip interval ticks, increase the snapshot interval before raising `ACORNOPS_AGENT_K8S_CONCURRENCY`; higher concurrency can increase API server pressure when list latency is already the bottleneck.

## Failure Modes

- Agent cannot connect: verify `ACORNOPS_AGENT_PLATFORM_URL`, DNS, TLS, and the platform `/api/v1/agent/connect` route.
- Authentication rejected: rotate or reissue the cluster agent key from the control plane.
- No telemetry: verify Kubernetes RBAC, namespace scope, metrics-server availability, and collector logs.
- Slow or skipped telemetry: inspect `watch-manager` and `snapshot-manager` logs, increase the snapshot interval if collection takes too long, then tune `ACORNOPS_AGENT_K8S_CONCURRENCY` and `ACORNOPS_AGENT_K8S_LIST_PAGE_LIMIT` if list fallback or relist recovery is the bottleneck.
- HA does not elect a leader: verify Lease RBAC and `leaderElection.enabled=true`.
- Tool rejected before execution: verify handshake session policy, local namespace maximum, and write enablement.
- Write tool times out: treat the outcome as unknown, retain the returned operation ID, and inspect the workload before deciding whether to retry the same tool call ID.

## Tool Safety Defaults

- Read tool concurrency: 4; write tool concurrency: 1; queued calls: 16 shared across both gates.
- Maximum tool input: 1 MiB; maximum serialized output: 2 MiB.
- Maximum scale target: 100 replicas; operators may configure a lower ceiling.
- Scale-to-zero is disabled unless both the operator and the caller confirm it.
- Namespace-scoped installs use their Role namespaces as the local maximum scope.

## Required Validation

Before chart or runtime changes:

```bash
npm run validate
npm run helm:check
```
