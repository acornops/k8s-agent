# K8s Agent Core Beliefs

- The agent is outbound-only and stateless by default.
- Capability advertising is a contract, not a hint.
- Snapshot volume must stay bounded and observable.
- Least-privilege RBAC and explicit write gating matter more than local convenience.
- Durable protocol rules belong in versioned docs and checks, not in prompt memory.
- Cross-repo contract changes must land with mirrored docs and checks.
