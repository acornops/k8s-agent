# K8s Agent Quality Score

Assessment date: April 10, 2026.

| Area | Score | Evidence | Main Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Control-plane contract alignment | 4/5 | Mirrored contract docs, manifests, repo checks | No replay harness for large degraded websocket sessions |
| Lifecycle reliability | 4/5 | Reconnect, handshake, heartbeat, and snapshot rules documented | More chaos-style reconnect coverage is still needed |
| Tool execution safety | 4/5 | Write gating, capability advertising, and tool metadata checks | More destructive-path validation coverage would help |
| Deployment safety | 3/5 | RBAC and deployment manifests exist, safety rules documented | More manifest regression checks would help |
| Harness knowledge base | 4/5 | AGENTS entry point, indexed docs tree, plan directories, quality/security/reliability docs | Freshness still depends on docs being updated with protocol changes |
